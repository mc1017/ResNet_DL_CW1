# Deep Learning CW 1 

Task of this coursework is to implement variations of ResNets, and perform a sweep for hyperparameter tuning. 

Wandb is used for hyperparameter tuning and tracking of training runs and sweeps. 

Resnet variations tested include: 
1. Traditional ResNet
2. [Wide ResNet, Zagoruyko et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146)
3. [Bottleneck ResNet, He et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385v1)

Achieved 95%+ for the assignment.
